<h2>Academic & Research Projects</h2>

<h3>AI-Driven GSI Performance Forecasting</h3>
<p>
Developed machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, LSTM) to predict ponding duration
using storm characteristics, design features, and environmental context.
</p>

<h3>Urban Stormwater Risk Assessment</h3>
<p>
Integrated inspection data, land cover, and social vulnerability indicators to evaluate
infrastructure performance risk at the city scale.
</p>

<h3>Advanced Machine Learning Vision Project</h3>
<p>
Graduate-level group project completed as part of <strong>ECE 8487: Advanced Machine Learning</strong> at Villanova University.
The project involved designing and evaluating deep learning models, including a Vision Transformer (ViT),
and integrating trained models into an application framework.
</p>
<p>
<strong>My contributions:</strong> Vision Transformer (ViT) model implementation, model evaluation and metrics analysis,
confusion matrix interpretation, and preparation of the final written report.
</p>
<p>
<em>Note: This was a collaborative graduate course project.</em>

<h3>Morland Catchment Information System (CIS)</h3>
<p>
Developed a catchment-scale decision support tool to explore how land-use change and climate change scenarios
affect hydrologic response using an Excel-based model with VBA automation.

<h2>Professional Projects</h2>

<h3>National Water Resources Modeling & Decision Support — Bangladesh</h3>
<p>
<strong>
  <a href="https://www.iwmbd.org" target="_blank">Institute of Water Modelling (IWM)</a>, Dhaka, Bangladesh
</strong>

</p>
<p>
Contributed to large-scale, government-commissioned water resources and urban infrastructure projects supporting flood
risk management, water supply planning, river pollution control, and environmental impact assessment across Bangladesh.
These projects informed national and municipal decision-making and provide the applied foundation for my current research
on AI-enabled and data-driven infrastructure resilience.
</p>

<p><strong>Key focus areas included:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Urban stormwater and flood modeling using <strong>SWMM, MIKE11/MIKE URBAN, HEC-RAS</strong>, and GIS-based analyses</li>
  <li>Flood inundation mapping, drainage master planning, and feasibility studies for rapidly growing municipalities</li>
  <li>River water quality modeling and pollution source assessment using <strong>MIKE11–ECO Lab</strong> and Python-based data analysis</li>
  <li>Reservoir water balance, hydrodynamic modeling, and operational scenario analysis for industrial water supply systems</li>
  <li>Environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA/SEIA), including air quality modeling and mitigation planning</li>
  <li>National-scale hydrologic data quality control, statistical analysis, and database development to support long-term water planning</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Representative government clients:</strong></p>
<p>
DPHE, DWASA, BEZA, WARPO, and the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Joint Bangladesh–Netherlands Programme).
</p>

<p>
This professional experience involved close collaboration with government agencies, international partners, and multidisciplinary
teams, translating complex modeling outputs into actionable recommendations for infrastructure investment, environmental protection,
and long-term resilience planning.
