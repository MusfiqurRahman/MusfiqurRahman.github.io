  2D Floodplain Inundation Modeling for a Restored River Reach (HEC-RAS 1D–2D)
  <span class="hover-card">
    <strong>Simulation and Analysis of 2D Flooded Area of River Spree (HEC-RAS 1D–2D Coupled Model)</strong><br>
    <span style="opacity:0.8;">Technical Report — Brandenburg University of Technology, Cottbus | Dec 14, 2018</span><br><br>

    <strong>Authors:</strong><br>
    Beza Getnet, Md Abdullah Al Mehedi, Md Zahidul Karim, Monjalina Hoque, <strong>Musfiqur Rahman</strong>, Sheila Ghimire<br><br>

    <strong>Summary:</strong><br>
    Diagnosed, stabilized and evaluated a coupled 1D channel + 2D floodplain unsteady-flow model in HEC-RAS to assess inundation patterns along an ~11 km restored reach of the Spree River and test flood mitigation strategies.<br><br>

    <strong>What we did:</strong><br>
    • Built a 1D–2D HEC-RAS unsteady model (1D main channel, 2D floodplain mesh) to simulate flood extent and water surface elevation under multiple scenarios.<br>
    • Performed sensitivity analysis on computational time step and mesh/grid dimensions and compared impacts on predicted flood depths and inundation patterns.<br>
    • Evaluated flood mitigation strategies including dike construction, dredging, and roughness (Manning’s n) changes to quantify reductions in floodplain inundation.<br><br>

    <strong>Methods / Tools:</strong><br>
    HEC-RAS (1D–2D coupling), unsteady flow routing, 2D mesh modeling, scenario analysis, sensitivity analysis, flood-depth comparison across cells.<br><br>

    <strong>Key takeaway:</strong><br>
    Model results showed sensitivity to time step and roughness and demonstrated that mitigation measures can significantly reduce inundation, while highlighting tradeoffs with ecological goals in renaturation projects.<br><br>

</strong>

</p>
<p>
Contributed to large-scale, government-commissioned water resources and urban infrastructure projects supporting flood
risk management, water supply planning, river pollution control, and environmental impact assessment across Bangladesh.
These projects informed national and municipal decision-making and provide the applied foundation for my current research
on AI-enabled and data-driven infrastructure resilience.
</p>

<p><strong>Key focus areas included:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Urban stormwater and flood modeling using <strong>SWMM, MIKE11/MIKE URBAN, HEC-RAS</strong>, and GIS-based analyses</li>
  <li>Flood inundation mapping, drainage master planning, and feasibility studies for rapidly growing municipalities</li>
  <li>River water quality modeling and pollution source assessment using <strong>MIKE11–ECO Lab</strong> and Python-based data analysis</li>
  <li>Reservoir water balance, hydrodynamic modeling, and operational scenario analysis for industrial water supply systems</li>
  <li>Environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA/SEIA), including air quality modeling and mitigation planning</li>
  <li>National-scale hydrologic data quality control, statistical analysis, and database development to support long-term water planning</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Representative government clients:</strong></p>
<p>
DPHE, DWASA, BEZA, WARPO, and the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Joint Bangladesh–Netherlands Programme).
